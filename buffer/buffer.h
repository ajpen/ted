/*
 * TextBuffer
 * This data structure represents the current buffer of the text editor.
 * It's essentially an array of gap buffers, each gap buffer representing a line in the file.
 *
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  one]
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  twp]
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  three]
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  four]
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  five]
 * [] -> [|                              |]    Blank line (with a full buffer)
 * [] -> NULL                                    No line. Signals end of the buffer
 * ...
 * [] -> NULL                                    Last element of the array. Signals end of capacity.
 *
 * Note that blank lines will have a buffer. This can be optimized later (with a performance penalty for inserts)
 * Array slots with a NULL pointer are non-existent lines, and signal the end of a file.
 *
 * Having the rows be an array allows constant lookup so file exploration is cheap.
 * Copying small strings is cheap so gap buffers for lines shouldn't be too expensive.
 *
 * Additionally, this structure will hold details about the current state of the text editor,
 * such as the cursor position (row, col).
 *
 * lines: array of GapBuffers representing the lines in a file.
 * lines_capacity: size of the lines array
 * cursorRow: row of the cursor
 * cursorCol: column of the cursor
 * cursorColMoved: whether the cursorCol changed (by a move operation for example)
 * last_line_loc: the last line in the buffer
 * */

/*
 * NewLine adds a new line to the buffer and moves the cursor to the start of that new line.
 * Handles the logic of hitting the return key.
 * Only works when at the end of the last line of the fine. Used to allow users to add more lines
 *
 * TODO: Add support for hitting return in the middle of a line, and also between other lines
 * e.g.
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  one]
 * [] -> [contents {}of line |       |  twp]
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  three]
 * In the TextBuffer above, {} is the cursor. What happens if Enter is hit at that location?
 * 1. The line needs to be split into two lines
 * 2. The new line needs to be placed immediately after the line that was split.
 * 3. The lines below need to be shifted down once
 *
 * The results of this:
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  one]
 * [] -> [contents|                  |]
 * [] -> [{}|                  |of line twp]
 * [] -> [contents of line |       |  three]
 *
 * Returns 0 or MEM_ERROR
