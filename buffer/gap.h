/*
 * Gap Buffer Data structure
 * A buffer that uses a "gap" within a string to allow addition of new characters to it.
 * The length of the buffer is the length of the gap + the length of the string
 *
 * Gap Buffer implements the buffer interface defined in base.h
 *
 * Implementation:
 * - The string is seen as a separate object starting from buffer[0] and extending str_len characters.
 * - The gap is always somewhere between this string, or at the prefix or suffix.
 * - The length of the buffer is always the sum of the string length and the gap length.
 * - The string is buffer[0:gap_loc-1] + buffer[(gap_loc+gap_len):(gap_loc+gap_len) + (str_len-gap_loc)]:
 *      - 0 to gap_loc-1 is the string up to the gap
 *      - (gap_loc+gap_len) is the index right after the gap
 *      - (gap_loc+gap_len) + (str_len-gap_loc-1) is the last index of the string.
