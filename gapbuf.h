/*
 * Gap Buffer Data structure
 * Allocates a fixed character array, with a "gap" of size `gap_size`.
 * New text is always inserted at the gap.
 * Deleted text is added as a prefix to the gap.
 *
 * Text can be added char by char or a string is copied.
 * If the gap is filled, a new buffer is allocated, at double the size, with the gap placed at the same location.
 * The gap moves, similar to a cursor, depending on where text is ment to be inserted. Movement is done by copying
 * the string.
 *
 * For example, if this is the gap
 *
 *    [aaaaaaaasasdsdadasdasdasdas__________________adasdasdadsdasdasdasdas]
 *
 * Adding "randomtext" does
 *
 *    [aaaaaaaasasdsdadasdasdasdasrandomtext________adasdasdadsdasdasdasdas]
 *
 *
 * Adding "tex" at index 3 does
 *
 *    [aaatex_________aaaaasasdsdadasrandomtextdsasdadasdasdadsdasdasdasdas]
 *
 * Deleting "random" does
 *
 *    [aaatexaaaaasasdsdadas_______________textdsasdadasdasdadsdasdasdasdas]
